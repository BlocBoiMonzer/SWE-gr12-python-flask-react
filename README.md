### Contribution

If you want to work with us, instead of working directly on the main branch, 

1. **Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:**
    Use GitHub Desktop to create a new branch and switch to it.

2. **Commit Changes:**
    After making changes, use GitHub Desktop to commit those changes to your feature branch.
    Write a descriptive commit message to explain what was done.

3. **Push Changes:**
    Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub. This will create the feature branch on GitHub.

4. **Pull Changes:**
    Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local copy up to date with your team's work.

5. **Handling Conflicts:**
    If there are merge conflicts when pulling, resolve them in your local copy, commit the changes, and push.

6. **Create Pull Request:**
    Once your feature or bug fix is complete and tested, use GitHub to create a pull request from your feature branch to the main branch.

7. **Review and Merge:**
    Team members can review the code in the pull request and discuss changes.
    Once everything looks good, merge the pull request into the main branch.
